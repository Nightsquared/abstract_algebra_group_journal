    "# Normal Subgroups and Internal Direct Products\n",
    "This page will determine which subgroups are normal subgroups, and if any combinations of normal subgroups qualify as internal direct products. I initially thought all subgroups would be normal because all subgroups are abelian, but a look at the subgroup diagram at https://hobbes.la.asu.edu/groups/ made me think otherwise:\n",
