Most could be discounted as possibilites based on having large cyclic subgroups (the Caylay tables on this site grouped elements in a cyclic subgroup of order 8 or more together) or by looking at the elements on the diagonal, i.e. the square of every element, and seeing if the identity appeared 8 times and two other elements appeared 4 times.

    "At a high level, it seems like the properties of K8:C2 are all the same, but the only way of knowing for sure is to make a bijection. To do this, I'll assume a bijection exists, determine what elements must be mapped to each other given that, and see if that bijection holds up under all operations.\n",
    "To start, we can clearly tell that the identities are the same (2 and e, that is). We also know that the other three elements in the center must map to each other (8, 5, a and a2, a3bab, abab). 5, a, a2, and abab are all the result of squares of other elements, while 8 and a3bab are not, so 8 must map to a3bab.\n",
    "Beyond this, however, I couldn't think of a way to distinguish which elements of each pairs where which. To get the full bijection, I believe I'll have to do some guessing and checking, or know more properties of elements. I'll continue that in the future.\n",
