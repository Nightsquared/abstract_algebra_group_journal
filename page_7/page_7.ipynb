I'll also be using the group Z_4 x Z-2 : Z_2 [from here](https://hobbes.la.asu.edu/groups/), mostly because I had a better time figuring out what was going on with this group (on some level, at least)."

    "Basically, generating the table requires performing replacements of equivalent elements (at least, I think that's what's happening), often in non-trivial ways (by programming standards). For example, $bab * a^3bab = a$ according to the table. This can be verified with $bab * a^3bab = a \\Leftrightarrow a^3bab = (bab)^{-1}a = (a^2bab)a \\Leftrightarrow abab = baba \\Leftrightarrow aba = babab^{-1} = babab$. $b$ is commutitive over $aba$ so this implies $aba = bbaba = aba$.\n",

    "the relationships in the other group (Z_4 x Z-2 : Z_2) seem to be clearer. The first part is the external direct product of Z_4 and Z-2 (EDIT: after the last class, I realized these where probably internal products). Based on the webpage, the : Z_2 part means semi-direct products, which I haven't learned and I couldn't understand simply based on the wiki page. If we learn about this in later classes I'll return to this.\n",
